TGN Persistent Recon Operations. 

Persistent recon ops was originally made for the TGN community. to combine some persistence with dynamically created large combined arms AOs with multiple small recon ops style objectives. That would scale better for smaller player bases. from 4 players to 24 players. Inspired both by invade and annex & dynamic recon ops. PRO fits just in the middle.

after the closure of the TGN arma server. ive put the files onto github for others to use. the scenario is highly editable and customizable and easy to port to other maps. I will be writing a how-to guide on editing it shortly.

The scenario requires Drongo's Map Population (DMP) from the steam workshop. no other mods are required.
